1. Write a main program that copies a given text file into another file
using SimpleReader to read the input file and SimpleWriter to write the output file.
The names of the input text file to be copied and of the destination file where
the copy is to be saved are provided as command-line arguments.
Assume that appropriate arguments will be provided and no error checking is necessary.
The command-line arguments are accessible by your
main program through the String[] args array parameter to the main method.

2. Copy and modify the previous main program so that it handles all possible IOExceptions
and main will not throw any IOException. Output meaningful error message(s) if an IOException occurs.

3. *** Copy and modify the previous main program so that it also includes appropriate
error checks on the command line arguments, e.g., missing arguments, missing input file,
non-readable input file, etc. (The java.io.File class provides helpful methods
to check some of the possible errors.)
